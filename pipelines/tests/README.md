# Test data folder

This folder is aimed at running test-mode scripts for validating the inference
pipeline on the test data. The test data is stored in subdirectories.

To run the test scripts, execute the following command from the `pipelines` directory:

```bash
% bash ./tests/test_run.sh ./tests/covid-19_r_2024-01-29_f_2023-11-01_t_2024-01-29/model_runs 1000 28
```
