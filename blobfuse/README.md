# Pyrenew Blobfuse Configuration

This directory serves as a project-specific fork of the [cfa-blobfuse-tutorial](https://github.com/cdcent).

> Make sure you have blobfuse2 installed before running this module.

This directory will mount pyrenew-hew blobs to `/mnt` and then symlink to a directory you specify (or the current directory if you don't supply an argument).

To run, make sure you're in the top level as your working directory (`pyrenew-hew`, and not `pyrenew-hew/blobfuse`).
1. Run `sudo chmod +x ./blobfuse/mount.sh`.
2. Run `sudo ./blobfuse/mount.sh`. This will mount to the top-level (pyrenew-hew)
3. Check to make sure `/mnt` has pyrenew blobs mounted and that symlinks have been created in your working directory (`pyrenew-hew/`).
4. Before attempting to remount, run the cleanup script `sudo ./blobfuse/cleanup.sh`.

You can, for convenience, use make commands:
- `make mount`
- `make unmount`
