The PyRenew-HEW project aims to create short-term forecasts of respiratory disease burden using the [PyRenew library](https://github.com/CDCgov/PyRenew) and several data sources:

- [x] **H**ospital Admissions from the [National Healthcare Safety Network](https://www.cdc.gov/nhsn/index.html)
- [x] **E**mergency Department Visits from the [National Syndromic Surveillance Program](https://www.cdc.gov/nssp/index.html)
- [x] **W**astewater virus concentration from the [National Wastewater Surveillance System](https://www.cdc.gov/nwss/index.html)

This is a work in progress, and not all data sources are currently integrated into the model.

This repository contains code for the [PyRenew-HEW model](pyrenew_hew/pyrenew_hew_model.py) itself, as well as [pipelines](pipelines) for running the model in production, and [utilities](hewr) for working with model outputs.

## Containers

The project uses GitHub Actions for automatically building container images based on the project's [Containerfile](Containerfile). The images are currently hosted on Github Container Registry and are built and pushed via the [containers.yaml](.github/workflows/containers.yaml) GitHub Actions workflow.

Images can also be built locally. The [Makefile](Makefile) contains several targets for building and pushing images. Although the Makefile uses Docker as the default engine, the `ENGINE` environment variable can be set to `podman` to use Podman instead, for example:

```bash
ENGINE=podman make container_build
# Equivalent to:
# podman build . -t cfa-stf-routine-forecasting -f Containerfile
```

Container images pushed to the Azure Container Registry are automatically tagged as either `latest` (if the commit is on the `main` branch) or with the branch name (if the commit is on a different branch). After a branch is deleted, the image tag is remove from the registry via the [delete-container-tag.yaml](.github/workflows/delete-container-tag.yaml) GitHub Actions workflow.

## Running Model Pipelines
> [!NOTE]
> Azure Batch Forecasting Pipelines can only be run by CDC internal users on the CFA Virtual Analyst Platform.

There are two ways to run Azure Batch Modeling Code:
1. [The Azure Command Center](#3-azure-command-center) - interactive/manual.
2. [Dagster Workflow Orchestration](#2-dagster-workflow-orchestration) - automated, feature rich GUI.

### 1. Azure Command Center
> Specific environment setup steps required can be found in the [Routine Forecasting Standard Operating Procedure](https://cdcent.github.io/cfa-stf-handbook/routine_forecast_sop.html).

You can run `uv run pipelines/azure_command_center.py` (or `make acc`) to launch the Azure Command Center.
- The Azure Command Center will check for necessary data before offering to run pipelines.
- You must have previously configured your Azure Credentials and Environment Variables. To do this, run `make config`, or follow the steps in the SOP.
- The Azure Command Center is meant to be a streamlined interface for interactively running in production.

### 2. Dagster Workflow Orchestration
To execute dagster workflows fully locally with this project, you'll need to have blobs mounted. However, you can also launch jobs locally and have them submit to Azure Batch.

#### Makefile Targets for Local Testing
If you'd like to test one or two model partitions at a time, you can have dagster execute on your machine. Take care not to run all model partitions or you will quickly put your VM into a coma.

For convenience, you can use these makefile targets to get blobfuse setup on a fresh setup. Dagster assumes mounts at `./blobfuse/mounts/` in the working directory.
- `make mount`: mounts the pyrenew-relevant blobs using blobfuse. Use this before launching locally-executed dagster jobs.
- `make unmount`: gracefully unmounts the pyrenew-relevant blobs.

It is not necessary to mount blobs locally if submitting to Azure Batch.

#### Local Development and Testing
> Prerequisites: `uv`. `docker`, a VAP VM with a registered managed identity in Azure.
> Contact cfatoolsteam@cdc.gov for assistance with the latter two.

The following instructions will set up Dagster on your VAP. However, based on the current configuration, actual execution will still run in the cloud via Azure Batch. You can change the `executor` option in `dagster_defs.py` to test using the local Docker Executor - this will require you to have setup Blobfuse.

0. Build the `cfa-stf-routine-forecasting` docker container locally. You can use `make container_build` for convenience. Make sure docker is running or podman is available, etc.
1. Run `uv run dagster_defs.py` and click the link in your terminal (usually [http://127.0.0.1:3000/]).
2. Using the run ID dagster provides, you can also find your jobs in Azure Batch Explorer.
3. Navigate to the Lineage page, where you can find your assets for materialization.
4. You need to select partitions when materializing model run assets. For this project, there are two dimensions: disease and location.
5. Locally, don't run more than two or three partitions at a time, or you will quickly crash your VAP VM, unless you change the executor.

For running the full pipeline with all partitions in Azure Batch, you can change the executor code at the very end of `dagster_defs.py` to always use the Azure Batch Executor. Alternatively, you can run directly on the production server. See the next section.

#### Production Scheduling

Pushes to main will automatically update the central Dagster Code Location Github Actions Workflow. From the central code server, you can run and schedule model runs and see other projects' pipelines at CFA.

To login to the production server, head to https://dagster.apps.edav.ext.cdc.gov/.
