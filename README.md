# PyRenew-HEW

The PyRenew-HEW project aims to create short-term forecasts of respiratory disease burden using the [PyRenew library](https://github.com/CDCgov/PyRenew) and several data sources: 

- [ ] **H**ospital Admissions from the [National Healthcare Safety Network](https://www.cdc.gov/nhsn/index.html) 
- [x] **E**mergency Department Visits from the [National Syndromic Surveillance Program](https://www.cdc.gov/nssp/index.html)
- [ ] **W**astewater virus concentration from the [National Wastewater Surveillance System](https://www.cdc.gov/nwss/index.html)

This is a work in progress, and not all data sources are currently integrated into the model.

This repository contains code for the [PyRenew-HEW model](https://github.com/CDCgov/pyrenew-hew/blob/main/pyrenew_hew/pyrenew_hew_model.py) itself, as well as [pipelines](https://github.com/CDCgov/pyrenew-hew/tree/main/pyrenew_hew) for running the model in production, and [utilities](https://github.com/CDCgov/pyrenew-hew/tree/main/hewr) for working with model outputs.

## Containers

The project uses GitHub Actions for automatically building container images based on the project's [Containerfile](Containerfile) and [Containerfile.dependencies](Containerfile.dependencies) files. The images are currently hosted on Azure Container Registry and are built and pushed via the [containers.yaml](.github/workflows/containers.yaml) GitHub Actions workflow.

Images can also be built locally. The [Makefile](Makefile) contains several targets for building and pushing images. Although the Makefile uses Docker as the default engine, the `ENGINE` environment variable can be set to `podman` to use Podman instead, for example:

```bash
ENGINE=podman make dep_container_build
# Equivalent to:
# podman build . -t pyrenew-hew-dependencies -f Containerfile.dependencies
```

Container images pushed to the Azure Container Registry are automatically tagged as either `latest` (if the commit is on the `main` branch) or with the branch name (if the commit is on a different branch). After a branch is deleted, the image tag is remove from the registry via the [delete-container-tag.yaml](.github/workflows/delete-container-tag.yaml) GitHub Actions workflow.
